# webhook-finder
Steals the webhook out of a pyinstaller tokenlogger


If you dont want to use my skidded version found in the releases spot do this
go to main.py and copy all that code to the very end of https://github.com/extremecoders-re/pyinstxtractor
so that it looks like this

Then run pyinstractor normally but once its done move main.pyc to the same directory as pyinstractor.py and press enter
enjoy the webhooks
